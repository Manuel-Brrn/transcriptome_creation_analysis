# This script modifies a GFF file by replacing contig IDs with corresponding chromosome names of the genome
# based on a mapping table. The mapping table is created beforehand.

mapping_file="mapping_table_modified.txt"

# Output GFF file with updated sequence names
output_file="modified_GFF_LI_2022.gff"

# Step 1: Create the mapping table
# This step extracts the correspondence between original sequence IDs and their new names from the GFF file
# and saves it into a file called mapping_table.txt.

# Step 2: Modify the mapping table if needed
# The user can edit mapping_table.txt manually to ensure it matches their desired chromosome names.
# Once updated, save the edited file as mapping_table_modified.txt for the script to use.
