# Processing Files for Mapping  

This repository contains various commands and scripts to process sequencing files for mapping. The steps include:  

- Searching for the required individuals.  
- Counting the number of reads for individuals with two FASTQ files.  
- Merging the FASTQ files and compressing them.  
- Converting files from `.bz2` to `.gz` format.  
- Renaming files to be compatible with the Gecko format.
